Some will learn, many do
Cover up or spread it out
Turn around, had enough
Pick and choose, or pass it on
Buying, heading for
Suffer now or suffer then
It's bad enough, I want the fear
Need the fear
'cause he's alone
He's alone
Well, if they're making it
Then they're pushing it
And they're leading us, along
The hassle of
All the screaming fits
That panic makes, remorse
After all, what's the point?
Course levitation is possible
If you're a fly, achieved and gone
There's time for this and, so much more
It's typical, create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope, or never care
Just use the key cause
He's alone
He's alone
Well, if they're making it
Then they're pushing it
And they're leading us, along
The hassle of
All the screaming fits
That panic makes, remorse!
